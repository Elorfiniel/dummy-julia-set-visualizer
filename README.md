## Disclaimer

This Julia Set Visualizer was developed at an early stage of my programming career. It contains aspects of design and coding styles that may not adhere to best practices. This repository is intended for fun and exploration, serving as a snapshot of my learning journey rather than a dedicated role-model project for others to learn from.

**Note**: As of now, I won't be actively responding to issues or making further improvements to the code. Feel free to explore and experiment, keeping in mind the context of its development.
